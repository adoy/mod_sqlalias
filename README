                SQL Alias Module for Apache 2.x
                ===============================

Sqlalias module will intercept specific URI requests and dispatch them 
to the appropriate page to be served using a MySQL alias table. The MySQL
alias table will hold aliases and their corresponding files. A file may
have more than one alias which references to it, but an alias cannot point
to more than one file.

INSTALL:
========

After obtaining the latest version of the sqlalias module source code, 
change into the source directory (mod_sqlalias), and run "./configure".
To see the various ways in which you can customize your installation, 
run "./configure --help".

The configure process will check your environment and prepare itself for
compiling the source code. If one or more of the prerequisites cannot be
found, configure will terminate with an error. You will need to resolve
this and run configure again.

If configure runs without error(s), you are ready to compile. To compile 
mod_sqlalias, run "make". If the source code does not compile, make sure
your environment is setup correctly. If you are convinced the source of the
failure is mod_sqlalias, gather all relevant information about your system such
as the Apache version, OS version, the configure statement you used, etc. and
contact pierrick@webstart.fr

Once mod_sqlalias is compiled, install it by running "make install".

It's also possible to add manualy the LoadModule directive into your apache
configuration file

LoadModule sqlalias_module /path/to/mod_sqlalias.so

CONFIGURATION:
==============

#
# SQL Alias Module can be configured on a full web server or just
# on specific virtual hosts.
#

<IfModule sqlalias_module>

#
# The SQLAliasEnable directive enables or disables the SQL Alias Engine.
# If it is set to off, this module does no runtime processing at all.
#
SQLAliasEnable  On

#
# The SQLAliasDbParam directive allows you to configure your mysql connection.
# You can configure the connection to use wether a TCP connection or a Unix socket.
#
SQLAliasDbParam hostname 127.0.0.1
SQLAliasDbParam username "root"
SQLAliasDbParam password "lolmdr"
SQLAliasDbParam database "test"
SQLAliasDbParam port 3306
SQLAliasDbParam socketfile "/path/to/mysql.sock"

#
# The SQLAliasQuery directive defines the MySQL query that will be executed to 
# get the rewrited URI. The first returned column must be the rewrite/redirect
# address for your source (this can be a relative path or an URI). 
# The second column (not mandatory) is the apache HTTP response code.
#
# SQLAliasQuery "SELECT destination, code FROM table WHERE source='%s' LIMIT 1"
#
SQLAliasQuery "SELECT dest FROM myalias WHERE source='%s' LIMIT 1"

#
# The SQLAliasFilter directive define filters.
# If the URI matches one of them, the rewriting will not take place.
# The directive can occur more than once, with each instance defining a filter.
#
SQLAliasFilter .php$

</IfModule>
